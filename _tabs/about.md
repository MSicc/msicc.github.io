![Me and my family 2023](/assets/img/2023/07/Famiglia_2023.jpg)

# Hi, I am Marco Siccardi.

(aka MSicc)

First and foremost, I am father of two young humans that are starting to navigate their life on their own and husband to a fantastic, patient and wonderful wife and loving mom.

I am also a .NET developer (currently working on approaching the full stack) and tech enthusiast. I started to learn the SWIFT programming language some time ago and plan to actively use it in future for native development as well.

I live in a combined ecosystem of Apple, Microsoft and Nintendo products where I try to squeeze the most out of their products for me and my family.

## Other spaces to find me

I escaped the bird cage some time ago to follow a mammoth on its path, you can (and you should) follow my traces there:

Without the cage, I have a clear view of the blue sky: :

After my escape from the birdcage, my paths still cross with others :

I am also entangled to an octopus that manages a lot of stuff for me with its tentacles:
