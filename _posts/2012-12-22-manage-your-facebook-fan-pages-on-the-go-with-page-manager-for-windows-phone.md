Today I want to present an awesome little app that helps you managing your Facebook fan pages while you are on the go. It is made by another WinPhan, [Srikanth Nair (follow him!)](https://twitter.com/SrikanthNairPro) from Australia.

After entering your Facebook account, all the pages that you are admin for are available to manage:

As you can see, you can add multiple pages with this app. Each page has a small dashboard with the most important functions, and you can pin several secondary tiles on your start screen:

The app allows you to easily post photos to your page and of course you can also add some nice words on your post. You are able to select a pic that is already on your device or take a new picture, which is essentially on events for Fan pages.

Of course the app is able to share links or simply update your status as well. The updating page is pretty self-explanatory:

What is also important if you manage a page on Facebook, are your Insights. These are the statistics about how many people are talking about your page, liking it and so on. And of course Page Manager lets you handle that, too:

Yes, the numbers of my Facebook page are not the best. If you want to help and change that, you can do by liking it [here](https://www.facebook.com/msiccsblog).

Page Manager for Windows Phone is a really powerful app to keep attention and manage your Facebook page. It is under constant development and will be coming to Windows 8 and receive some Windows Phone 8 features. At the moment the app is running both Windows Phone 7 and 8.

The app has a trial with limited function. I am using it for month now, and I can only tell you that the app is worth every cent (1,49 € / 1,99 $ / £ 1.29). You can download it by scanning or clicking the barcode below:
