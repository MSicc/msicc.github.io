Some of you know that the dedicated Windows Phone app for msicc.net is ready for nearly a month now. Sadly Microsoft does not allow fan sites to use any kind of their logo(s). So the app got rejected a few times just because of the logo.

Luckily Dominik, the guy behind my logo, patiently created new logos until the actual one. This time all went smooth, and the app finally got approved.

Now to the most important thing: What do you get with MSicc’s Blog for Windows Phone?

- fast and slick blog Reader for MSicc.net
- unique Metro styled app
- read the most recent posts and browse categories or search msicc.net
- read and post comments
- share our posts with you friends
- image gallery for posts

What will come with an update:

- themes (input is welcome)
- save images from gallery to your phone
- live tile and toast notification

Here are some screenshots for you:

(Update) MSicc’s Blog for Windows 8 v1 now available!

Today I got notified by Microsoft that MSicc’s Blog for Windows 8 is certified! It provides similar functionality like the Windows Phone app, and will also be under constant development.

You can download the Windows 8 app here: <http://w8dev.so/msiccsblog>.
