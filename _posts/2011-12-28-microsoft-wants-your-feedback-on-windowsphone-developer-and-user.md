With the release of Windows Phone Mango Microsoft issued also two new Feedback programs.

# First I want to have al look on the developer-part:

Microsoft created a userchoice.com-site for developers, which can be found [here.](http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-app-platform) Recently they extended the page with an dedicated app for Windows Phone.

Here are some shots:

![Screen Capture (13)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-13.jpg "Screen Capture (13)") ![Screen Capture (14)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-141.jpg "Screen Capture (14)") ![Screen Capture (16)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-161.jpg "Screen Capture (16)") ![Screen Capture (20)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-20.jpg "Screen Capture (20)") ![Screen Capture (24)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-24.jpg "Screen Capture (24)") ![Screen Capture (22)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-22.jpg "Screen Capture (22)")

You can vote for an existing topic or create a new one. For every topic you can give up to 3 votes, with a summary maximum of 10. There is a description which can be added to a topic. Also you can add your own comment on the topic. Check the shots below:

![Screen Capture (26)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-26.jpg "Screen Capture (26)") ![Screen Capture (28)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-28.jpg "Screen Capture (28)") ![Screen Capture (30)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-30.jpg "Screen Capture (30)")

So if you are a developer, head over to the marketplace and [download](http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=b5466109-2b8d-46f4-9461-c959e433ae4a) this app to give feedback to Microsoft.

# Let´s have a look at the consumer part of the feedback program:

[Here](Here) you can have a look on the page for the consumer feedback. The App for consumer looks very similar to the developer feedback app, as you can see on this shots:

![Screen Capture (15)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-151.jpg "Screen Capture (15)") ![Screen Capture (19)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-19.jpg "Screen Capture (19)") ![Screen Capture (23)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-23.jpg "Screen Capture (23)")![Screen Capture (25)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-25.jpg "Screen Capture (25)") ![Screen Capture (27)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-27.jpg "Screen Capture (27)") ![Screen Capture (34)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-34.jpg "Screen Capture (34)")

Of course there is the same functionality for a topic as in the developer version: Give up to 3 votes for a topic, read or add a description as well as leave a comment:

![Screen Capture (10)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-10.jpg "Screen Capture (10)") ![Screen Capture (11)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-11.jpg "Screen Capture (11)") ![Screen Capture (12)](/assets/img/2011/12/Screen-Capture-12.jpg "Screen Capture (12)")

So if you want to tell Microsoft what you want to have on your OS, head over to the marketplace an [download](http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=30f4a6af-d742-452d-9f90-aeed254f3d42) the app right now.

There are some topics which are flagged with “started” on both the developer as well as the consumer feedback program. It seems really Microsoft hears to its customers.

Please provide feedback, only with this Microsoft will deliver those features we are waiting for!
