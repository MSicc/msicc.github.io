### Bitcoin, Crypto payments &amp; Linux (moving out of my comfort zone)

At the beginning of 2019, I was working on the C#-SDK for AtomicPay, a crypto payment provider. I was also working on a mobile administration app for AtomicPay but during the year, the regulatory rules changed in Switzerland for KYC (know your customer). I had to stop my efforts in this area because, for an indie developer, they are just impossible to handle.

That didn’t stop me to discover other crypto/blockchain stuff, and so I did move out of my comfort zone to play around with a Linux Server and implementing a Bitcoin full node on it. You can read more on this in the [Crypto&amp;Blockchain](https://msicc.net/category/cryptoblockchain/) section of my blog.

Even though my efforts have shifted back towards mobile applications, the blockchain area is still of interest to me.

### Xamarin, Xamarin, Xamarin

All of my mobile side projects this year were deeply tied into the Xamarin universe. The biggest milestone I finally achieved this year was to finish the porting of my very first application ever from Windows Phone to Android and iOS. I wrote about some of the things I learned right here:

The last few weeks I was busy to write a barcode scanning control for Xamarin Forms that uses native capabilities on iOS and Firebase ML on Android. It was only last week that I finally got both variants working.

I attempted to write more regularly this year, but I clearly failed to keep up with it. One of my new year’s resolution is to keep a steady schedule of writing, as the list of what I want(ed) to write about is growing. I will go through this list during my upcoming vacation and try to find a better rhythm for my blogging efforts besides work and working on my side projects.

This year’s review is a bit different from the years before. I kept it short, focusing on the important parts (from my point of view). There is just one thing left to do in this post – to wish you all

## A Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year!
