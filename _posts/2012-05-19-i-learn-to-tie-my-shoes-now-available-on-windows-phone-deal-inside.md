In January 2011 Internet Security specialist AVG released a study. This study tells us that nowadays children get in touch with technical gadgets much earlier than in the past, while they are not able to manage everyday things like tying their shoes.

The study substantiates this also with figures: around 19% of the 2-5 year old children are able to use smartphone apps, while only 9% know how to tie their shoes.

As father of two kids, I decided to use the abilities of the little ones, and do something against that alarmingly low now number of kids, who know how to tie shoes.

I hope this app helps you and your children to learn tying of shoes very quick, easy and with fun.

**The app provides following features:**

- two methods of tying shoes
- controllable animation that shows tying
- step by step guide
- rhymes
- theme selection (currently standard, boys, girls)
- German and English language

The app will be available at the price of 99 cent. Like all my other apps, it has of course a trial version.

**Trial version provides:**

- the first five steps both in animation and the guide
- one of four rhymes
- standard theme

**What is coming next?**

- more languages (coming with the next update: Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Russian)
- more themes
- themed tiles to pin to start screen

To celebrate the launch of this app, I will start a “Marketplace Roulette”.

Currently, the app is available for free only via this [marketplace link](https://windowsphone.com/s?appid=99e6dae0-ff2c-4d5d-b81d-287c142dd6c4). I will change the pricing at a suitable moment within the next few days to the above mentioned 99 cents and make it publically available. Until this moment, you can download it for free only via this link.

Finally, here are some screenshots from the app:
