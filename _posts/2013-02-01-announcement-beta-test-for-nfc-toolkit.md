NFC Toolkit, my latest app project, is ready for a first beta look.

If you want to take part in this beta, please consider following points before applying:

- You need a WP8 device with NFC
- You will need NFC tags for now, as communication between devices is still in development
- You are willing to give serious feedback to improve the app

This will be a long time beta, means that even if the app goes live for all customers, I will continue developing with this beta before launching new versions. If you join the beta, you can use and test all new features before all others.

NFC Toolkit aims at normal users, that donâ€™t need all to technical information but want to use NFC.

The beta has following features at the moment:

- basic tag reading
- tag writing of most commonly used tag scenarios
- profiles! This is one of the main features of NFC Toolkit. It is all about settings based on a NFC tag.
- more unique features to come!
