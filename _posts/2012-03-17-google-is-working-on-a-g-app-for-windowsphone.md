Just a few minutes after I switched off my PC today, I received a note that is worth to share.

According to Google Germany´s press spokesperson [Stefan Keuchel](https://twitter.com/#!/frischkopp), Google is working on an app for their social network.

As you can see, [@dominiksichling](https://twitter.com/#!/dominiksichling) asked him on Twitter whether and when an G+ app for Windows Phone will be released.

Google´s answer: there is no date yet, but it is coming.

Good to see that also Microsoft competitors are working on apps for Windows Phone. This shows that Windows Phone finally is gaining really some attention.

Feel free to leave your thinkings in comments below.
