This year, I had some rough time to keep me motivated on writing blog posts. In the early months, I was keeping my target to write about Xamarin Forms and my implementations, but I slowly lost pace around the summer.

### Xamarin posts

Within the first half of the year, I was keeping a pretty constant 2 week frame for new blog posts, targeting Xamarin and Xamarin Forms. I touched several topics (some of which may be obsolete since Xamarin Forms 3.x). Here is a short recap:

- [\#XfQaD: Using ProgressRing for UWP and keep a single activity indicator API in Xamarin.Forms]({% post_url  2018-01-26-xfqad-using-progressring-for-uwp-and-keep-a-single-activity-indicator-api-in-xamarin-forms %})
- [\#XfQaD: read package identity and version from platform project with Xamarin.Forms]({% post_url 2018-02-13-xfqad-read-package-identity-and-version-from-platform-project-with-xamarin-forms %})
- [\#XfQaD: Limit maximum lines of Label and indicate text truncation]({% post_url 2018-03-21-xfqad-limit-maximum-lines-of-label-and-indicate-text-truncation %})

- [Using the built-in UWP data protection for data encryption]({% post_url  2018-05-01-using-the-built-in-uwp-data-protection-for-data-encryption %})
- [Xamarin.Forms, Akavache and I: Initial setup (new series)]({% post_url 2018-05-06-xamarin-forms-akavache-and-i-initial-setup-new-series %})

- [Xamarin.Forms, Akavache and I: ensuring protection of sensitive data]({% post_url 2018-05-22-xamarin-forms-akavache-and-i-ensuring-protection-of-sensitive-data %})

### The rise of crypto and blockchain

Since 2017, I was loosely following the area of crypto currencies and blockchain. This year, however, marks the beginning of a deeper dive into the blockchain area – and of course also into crypto currencies. I am not advising anyone to invest any money into crypto currencies, but there are certain projects out there that are really interesting. Two of them are social networks, similar to Tumblr: [Steemit]({% post_url 2018-07-16-how-steemit-changed-the-way-i-use-traditional-social-networks %}) and [Trybe](https://trybe.one/ref/5662/). While Steemit is running on its own blockchain, Trybe is utilizing the EOS blockchain. Sadly, the .NET world seems to be widely ignored, so I stepped down a bit from posting on those two. I also tested several other networks running on or with blockchain, but none of them took me like the two mentioned above. If you want to learn more about the crypto currencies/projects I am interested in, just head over to my [crypto page]({{ site.url }}/tags/cryptocurrencies/).

### Open Source

Even if I did not made a lot of sound around it, I have worked on some libraries this year. I am not going into detail on every one, just head over to my Github:

- [WordPressReader (Standard)](https://github.com/MSiccDev/WordPressReaderStd)
- [SteemConnect.NET (archived due to low interest)](https://github.com/MSiccDev/SteemConnect.Net)
- [CoinPaprika .NET Client](https://github.com/MSiccDev/CoinpaprikaAPI)

I am currently working on another library (targetting crypto payments) – I will write about it once it is ready to be used in your projects.

### RIP UniShare

One of the sadest moments this year was the death of UniShare, my most popular Windows (Phone) app. Long story short, due to some changes Facebook made to their API, I had to take UniShare to its funeral at the end of October. [Read more about it here](https://msiccdev.net/2018/09/22/unishare-discontinued-will-disappear-by-october-31th-here-is-why/).

### Looking forward to 2019

In 2019, I will continue my journey within the crypto/blockchain world. Like I wrote above, I am working on a crypto related project at the moment, which I hope to have ready in the early weeks of 2019. One of my other projects, [WindowsUnited](https://msiccdev.net/android/windowsunited/), will be taken over by another developer in 2019 (because he can invest more time into their official apps and work form them more ore less exclusively). This will free up some recsources, which I am trying to invest in my other projects and the rise of my blogging pace (again).

Thanks to all of you for reading my posts this year. I hope you’ll be with me in 2019 as well. I wish all of you a good arrival in 2019 and a happy new year once it arrives.

### Until the next post, happy coding, everyone!
