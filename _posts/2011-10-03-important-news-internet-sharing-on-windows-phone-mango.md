Microsoft´s Joe Belfiore today announced that Internet Sharing or Tethering will be supported on new Windows Phone handsets.

Many of us – especially those who are long-term WP7-users – may think that this is really bad for us. I am waiting also for this features, and told this to Mr. Belfiore:

Here is what he responded:

So let´s hope that all OEM´s will soon update their drivers…

\[Update\] According to the German Site [wp7app.de](https://wp7app.de/2802/news/htc-news-2.html#more-2802), HTC will publish a firmware update by mid of October, which will enable the mobile Hotspot feature. For Samsung devices exists a workaround to get the Internet Sharing activated – however this is no official way.

So it seems that almost HTC is caring about their existing devices. Good news so far.
