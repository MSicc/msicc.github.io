My Fishing Knots app has been updated to version 1.4

# WhatÂ´s new?

I added completely reworked graphics to the app. The images are now also following your background color (black or white).

Of course you have still the former features like:

- controllable animations
- read aloud the instructions for a knot
- 3-step instructions with image and text

Of course the German an the Italian version have this update, too.
