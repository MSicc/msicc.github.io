Today I submitted version 1.6 of Fishing Knots to the Marketplace.

It contains only a few new features:

– overhauled user interface

– integrated Italian and German language

– minor bug fixes

Here is a short video that demonstrates the new version:

Breaking changes are coming to “Angelknoten +” and “Nodi della pesca +”.

As I integrated the German and Italian language in Fishing Knots to make it easier for me to maintain the app (one is easier than three), both before mentioned apps will be discontinued.

Once you installed the update to 1.5.9, you will be prompted to install “Fishing Knots +”. The app will be free for one week to give everybody the possibility to install it for free.

Why am I doing this?

That´s relatively easy to explain: This was my first app ever and I wasn’t aware of the localization possibilities in the beginning of development. So I did three apps. Now that I know how I can integrate additional languages to an app, this has to be changed.

I am sorry for any inconvenience and hope you will understand this move.

“Fishing Knots +” will be the version I will update constantly.
