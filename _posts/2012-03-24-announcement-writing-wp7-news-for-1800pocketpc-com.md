Yesterday Saijo George, owner of 1800PocketPC.com, asked me to join the team. As I love this site, of course I accepted the offer.

**How will this affect my blog?**

Well, on some entries in Windows Phone category, you will find a short version of the post, for reading the whole article you will be redirected to my post at 1800PocketPC.

It is a huge step for me, so I hope you all understand this move.

I will still run this blog, as I cover Windows Phone news for 1800PocketPC, and my Blog is all about Microsoft.
