Just a few weeks ago I wrote about [how the GEMA cuts the user experience in Germany.]({% post_url 2011-11-19-how-the-gema-user-experience-in-germany %})

Today, the GEMA and BITKOM announced that they finally reached an agreement for internet music services. The Federal Association for information technology, telecommunications and new media e.V. (BITKOM) is the Trade Association of the German information and telecommunications industry.

The agreement covers the amount of copyright remuneration which must be dissipated by the operators of Internet music portals. License fees are per piece of music now usually between 6 and 9 cent net.

Because of this agreement, music stores are now able to offer previews with a length up to 90 seconds.

The agreement also includes licensing of copyright for streaming services over the Internet. “Individual services that are successful abroad, find that similar licensing conditions in Germany,.” “We go therefore the assumption that there will be even more music services in Germany, in which users for a monthly flat fee entirely online can listen all tracks”, as BITKOM Vice-President Smid. “This online business models in the music business for suppliers and users are much more attractive than ever before.”

Ad-funded music services and music videos are not covered until now from the contract. To do this, BITKOM and GEMA will further continue their negotiations, as well as for online video services.

Update: Yesterday the GEMA announced also a tariff for ad-funded music services. The prices are set only from the GEMA – means there is no agreement with BITKOM. BITCOM said it was a locigal consequence, that the GEMA was raising up a tarif. They will prove how they can work with the new tariff.

Let´s hope that in near future all content provider like Spotify and Microsoft with Zune Pass will let us receive the same user experience as in the rest of Europe/the World.
