As some of you know, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer himself visited Berlin a few days ago. First I want to apologize for the delay this post has, but sometimes there are things that can push things back. I am still amazed about the fact that I was able to attend this event.

The evening started with a short introduction of the recent Milestones Microsoft achieved, presented by Microsoft Germany CEO Peter Jaeger. The second part was about to show the integration of cloud services, presented my MS Germany Developer Evangelist Gunter Logemann. He reminds us developers to use the advantages of this integrated services.

At some point Steve Ballmer entered the room, and we all got a bit more nervous (yes, I was only two meters away from him!)

He was introduced with his own Windows Phone screen ad video, and started with a little joke that he was wondering who was talking while he enters the stage. Great start for his exclusive keynote.

He then switched to do what he is very good at: talking about Microsoft products and the possibilities they offer. He started with some numbers and feedback about Windows 8. In only 14 days, there were more than 4 million upgrades to Windows 8, and the press and blogosphere was positive about Windows 8. He was absolutely charmed about J. Topolsky`s comment: “Who have thought that in 2012 Microsoft would be the company with the boldest phone and software design?”. And of course we all were charmed about that, too.

Then he introduced the ecosystem “Windows” to us. No matter which device, Windows will be the core experience. And this experience is alive with activity – the user’s (our) activity. No matter if you are on your PC, tablet or on your phone or Xbox.

He continues that Microsoft is “All In” with the new Metro design language (well, he called it Windows 8 style, but we all know he wanted to say Metro). All main products where updated to the new design language to make a unique UX across all devices.

Steve is still amazed about how fast and fluid content is synchronized across devices via the Microsoft cloud – even though Microsoft created this whole experience. And every developer is invited to use it to create amazing apps!

Nearly at the end of his speech some developers where honored for Windows 8. Their apps were created in the Darkside Bakery project and are already available on the Windows Store.

Sadly I did not have to opportunity to talk to himself or at least shake his hand. But it was amazing enough to see and hear him live and in person. Thank you, Microsoft, for this very unique experience I do not want to miss! Steve’s speech was really motivating, and I will go “All In” with Microsoft. How about you?
