Hi everybody, ![PlayerLockScreen")](/assets/img/2011/07/playerlockscreen.png)


I just made a video and some shots of playing around with the Developer-Build of Windows Phone Mango. You´ll find the video on the end of my post.

Let´s start with the lock screen, while playing music. As you can see the resized play controls are on it as well as the artists picture which is shown in the music hub.

Now let´s get funny within the Games Hub. As you can see on the picture and in the video, while playing music your avatar is dancing around.

As I have done this yesterday for the first time, my avatar got a windows phone in his handy and played around. After that, my avatar started dancing.

I tried to recreate the windows phone prop to rest the phone in its hand, but I had no success with it. I will update this post whenever I found the solution.

Ok, let´s head over to the marketplace. On the initial page we have now a dedicated search button. In this build you can search only using this button, the windows phone search key does not work within the marketplace.

The results will be displayed with to pages, apps &amp; games as well as music:

The view in the app page has also changed. There are now 4 pages, details, reviews, screenshots and related. I will dive deeper into this in another blog post.

![insidemp3](/assets/img/2011/07/insidemp3.png "insidemp3"){: .normal}

In the messaging hub you can choose whether you want to type in your message or if you tell the phone the text and it will be converted into your message.

Finally, here is the whole video.
