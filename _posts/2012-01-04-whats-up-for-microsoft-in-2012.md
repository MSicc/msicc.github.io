Today I want to give a sneak preview of what we can expect from Microsoft this year.

Several dates are just fixed:

# January 10-13: [CES](http://www.cesweb.org/)

This will be Microsoft´s last appearance on the Consumer Electronic Show. While this decision started a controversial discussion last year, we will sure see some new features for our Xbox, Windows Phone and probably on Windows 8. Also Nokia is located with a big stand, so I guess there will sure be some Windows Phone news. Maybe we developers will get again some beta of the next Windows Phone version? Or a [Windows Phone by Sony (Ericsson)?](http://www.wpcentral.com/wild-speculation-post-sony-ericsson-windows-phone-next-week-ces)

# February 27 – March 1: [Mobile World Congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/)

Well, this will be an interesting thing for me from two parts: first as an employee of Telefonicá, which has always something big to tell about their on-going projects like [BlueVia](https://bluevia.com/en/), the API-program of them. The world central is also located in Spain, so it is only natural that there will be a huge presence of Telefonicá. Second part is from my part as Microsoft fan. I expect further details about the next version of Windows Phone, and also some news about the tablet capabilities of Windows 8.

# March 9-18: [SWSX Interactive](http://sxsw.com/)

Last year, we all received our fantastic IE9. What happens this year? IE10? Windows 8? Xbox? Well, actually there is nothing concrete, so I have to update this when there will be news.

# April: [MIX](http://visitmix.com/)

Well, if you click on that site, there are no news about a conference this year. Maybe it will be mashed up in this years Build. MS itself has no information to share at the moment.

# June 5-7: [E3 Expo](http://www.e3expo.com/)

This is Microsoft´s primary Xbox Stage, and so we will normally see a lot of new Games both for Windows Phone and Xbox (like in 2011). I think there will be also some new apps around there, as the Xbox is now our multimedia centre in our living rooms.

# June 11-14: **[TechEd 2012](http://northamerica.msteched.com)** 

This is for pros and devs and is normally about already announced products. This is primarily for North America.

# June 25-29: **[TechEd Europe 2012](http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/)** 

After cancelling last year’s TechEd Europe, Microsoft is set to hold this year´s event.

# July 9-13 **[Worldwide Partner Conference 2012](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Microsoft-Worldwide-Partner-Conference-2012-2639423)**

Microsoft is annually holding this event to thank their partners, show their roadmaps. As the trend for cloud computing continues, I guess there will be a large time of talking about the cloud, the cloud and the cloud.

# November 12-15 **[SharePoint Conference 2012](http://www.mssharepointconference.com/Pages/default.aspx)** 

As until now there is nothing about Office, Office 365 and SharePoint around, I guess this will be the scheduled launch conference for the updated 2012 product line.

So now you have a smart oversight about this years Microsoft events. Surely this list will be updated from time to time, as there are missing some events:

# **[Build](http://www.buildwindows.com/) 2012**

As it seems without a doubt the year of Windows 8 and the next version of Windows Phone, I am sure there will be an event. At this moment there is no information about it, but the missing MIX-conference is another indicator for this event to happen.

As I mentioned above, I will steadily update this post to keep the list up to date.
