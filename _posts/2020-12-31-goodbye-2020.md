In the beginning of 2020, I was polishing up the app for my personal blog as well as my WordPress reader library. I started to write a series about my experience on implementing push notifications with Azure which I still must finish.

During the spring lockdown, I also started a new project, which is now in the MVP (minimum viable product) state. I started to improve the overall performance by moving parts of the application to the cloud (ongoing process). I hope I will be able to share more on this project soon, but here’s already a screen shot:

As I haven’t done any interview for close to 6 years at that time, I decided to “play the game” to gain some refreshing experience. I went through the entire process (which was also different due to COVID-19) and was offered the job – in the end, I accepted it.

Since I am changing my employer, I was quite busy in the last three months of the years to finish the work I started in my daytime job – which is the reason I was so quiet during that time.

2020 was a challenging year (mostly due to COVID-19). Overall, my family and I went through it and did handle most challenges quite well. My biggest personal achievement in 2020: I finally freed myself from the slavery of nicotine and became a non-smoker. Besides that, Santa did an excellent job again this year and upgraded my computer to a MacBook Pro:

We will still need to keep distance, wear masks, and wash our hands (and stay at home as much as possible). I am sure there will be other challenges and hopefully plenty of chances as well.
