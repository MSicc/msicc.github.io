The book is split into three parts. The first one covers the basics of MVVM and .NET MAUI, while the second one goes hands on a full recipe app sample. The third part goes even deeper into specific topics every .NET MAUI developer should know about.

### Part 1: Explaining MVVM and .NET MAUI

 In the first part, the book covers what MVVM is with the help of easy understandable samples that make it easy for beginners to understand the pattern, but didn’t annoy me as an experienced developer as well. After that, you’ll get a well dosed overview of .NET MAUI and how it supports MVVM. The book also shows you hot the CommunityToolkit can be used to enhance your applications. The first part is closed by teaching you a thing or two about collections and how .NET MAUI handles them. Once you finish the first part, you should be well-prepared for both MVVM and .NET MAUI.

### Part 2: Getting your hands dirty

The second part involves a full recipe app sample written in .NET MAUI using the MVVM pattern. The code for every chapter can be downloaded individually from GitHub (links in the book). The sample starts with DependencyInjection and Messaging after outlining the technical requirements. After that, the author takes an in-depth look at navigation and how to pass values around during navigation, followed by validation of user inputs. The second part gets concluded by adding remote data from a Web-API.

### Part 3: Going even deeper

The third part of the book kicks off with explaining how to create MVVM-friendly controls that can enhance our applications. Next, it covers localization and provides a fully reusable implementation. Before concluding the third part with some really helpful troubleshooting and debugging tips, the author shows how unit tests can easily enhance the code quality of an application.

### Conclusion

The author did a great job with this book. All explanations are well-structured and easy to understand. It is very easy to follow the samples. Even if you get stuck in the process, there is always the completed solution inside the sample code on GitHub to spy on.

Even for me as an experienced Xamarin.Forms / .NET MAUI developer, this book had some good inputs and – even more important – learnings included. This book is from now on my default recommendation when it comes to .NET MAUI and MVVM, for both experienced and new developers.
