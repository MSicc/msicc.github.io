On 6/8/2011, several companies and websites are testing the new IPv6-adress-standard.

The old standard IPv4 has to be replaced, as there are no more free slots.

Sites like Google, Facebook and Yahoo! are joining this test.

Also Microsoft participates with [Bing](www.bing.com) and [Xbox.com](https://www.xbox.com/).

Learn more about this day on the site of [the ISOC (Internet Society)](https://isoc.org/wp/worldipv6day/participants/).

There is also a little [Test-Site](https://test-ipv6.com/) to check if you will be running into problems with your current configuration.

Here you will find the wikipages of IPv4 and IPv6:
