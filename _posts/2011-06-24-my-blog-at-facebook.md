Hi everybody,

My blog has now a page on Facebook.

You can like my page here: http://on.fb.me/mJW5ui

Because of the page rules on Facebook, I need a minimum of 25 likes to be able to create a username for my page.

So please help me and give me a like as certain services to connect with Facebook are only available with a username.

UPDATE:

I still need a couple of likes so please go to my Facebook page and click the button! I will remove this post from sticky as soon as I got my username.

Thanx for your help in advance and greets to you all.
