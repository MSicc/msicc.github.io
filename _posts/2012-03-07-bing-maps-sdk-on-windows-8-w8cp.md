Microsoft´s Bing Maps team released a new SDK for Windows 8. You can use the SDK free and unlimited during the preview period.

The new SDK supports Java by using the AJAX v7 controls, and provides all standard items like map types, pushpins, infoboxes and tile layers. Additionally there is now a venue Maps module. At the moment there are still some missing bits like directions, traffic and overlays. Your maybe previous used REST APIs will still work and help you to use more features. If you want to learn on an example, you can [watch this site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852186.aspx).

Of course you can also use C#, C++ or Visual Basic to create apps that are using the SDK. The SDK now supports client vendor rendering as well as full hardware acceleration.You can also use Aerial and Bird´s eye view and traffic overlays within you app. Some features are in this early stage US only. You can learn on an example [on this MSDN page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852186.aspx).

**Getting started…**

OC course, you need to download the SDK to get started overall: [http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0c341dfb-4584-4738-949c-daf55b82df58](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0c341dfb-4584-4738-949c-daf55b82df58 "http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0c341dfb-4584-4738-949c-daf55b82df58"). You can also use the VS11 Extension Manager to download the SDK.

Secondly, you will net a special “Metro style apps (BETA) key” to use the SDK within you apps. Get your key at [www.bingmapsportal.com](http://www.bingmapsportal.com) .
